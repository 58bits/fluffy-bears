This is an educational site designed to teach basic browser safety, including often-used tactics by malicious sites that attempt to trick visitors into downloading malware. The site can also be used to teach users about HTTPS certificate warnings since there is a self signed certificate in use (visitors will have to manually type in the HTTPS prefix).

If a user clicks on the button, the site will attempt to download the eicar.com virus test file, which should trigger a warning if correctly configured anti-virus software is installed.
